# Raw Idea: Workflow Input Panel

**Workflow Input Panel**

Build Demo Viewer input panel with:
1. Multi-line prompt textarea (button submit only, no Enter shortcut)
2. Run Workflow button that spawns `agents/main.py` with `--prompt`, `--workflow-id`, and `--trace-id` CLI args
3. Hybrid identity display showing short `workflow_id` (wf-xxx) with copy button and OTEL `trace_id` with optional X-Ray console link
4. Execution timer
5. Validation states for missing entry script or AWS credentials

Note: The `main.py` is generated by Kiro spec-driven development, not by this extension.
