# Raw Idea

Demo Design Step — Build wizard step 7 for capturing demo presentation strategy:

**Key "Aha Moments" (repeatable field group):**
- Moment title: "What should impress the audience?" — e.g., "Real-time SAP inventory sync"
- When it occurs: dropdown selecting which agent/tool triggers this moment
- What to say: suggested talking point for presenter

**Demo Persona:**
- Persona name (text): e.g., "Maria, Regional Inventory Manager"
- Persona role (text): e.g., "Reviews morning replenishment recommendations for 12 stores"
- Persona pain point (text): e.g., "Currently spends 2 hours manually checking stock levels"
- AI assist: "Generate Persona" button creates persona based on industry/objective context

**Narrative Flow:**
- Ordered list of demo scenes (drag-to-reorder)
- Each scene: title, description, which agents are highlighted
- "Generate Narrative" button: model proposes scene sequence based on agent design

**Output:**
- Stored in wizard state for `demo-strategy.md` generation in Phase 4
