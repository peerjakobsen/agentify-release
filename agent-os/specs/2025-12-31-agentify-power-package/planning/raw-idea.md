# Raw Idea: Agentify Power Package

**Agentify Power Package** — Create Kiro Power that bundles steering guidance and enforcement hooks. This is a generic package installed during project initialization (extends Item 4), not per-ideation. Ensures all agent code follows Agentify patterns from day one.

Key elements:
- Power structure with POWER.md and hooks/ directory
- Enforcement hooks for observability, CLI contracts, tool patterns, and gateway handlers
- Steering guidance for pre-bundled infrastructure, decorator order, agent handler patterns
- Gateway Lambda handler patterns
- Event emission patterns
- AgentCore CLI deployment guidance
- Common pitfalls documentation
- Distribution bundled with Agentify extension
