Instruct agent to use handoff_to_agent tool when handing off, OR\n2. Instruct agent to return JSON with handoff_to field\n\nExample instruction:\n```\nWhen you need another agent's help, use the handoff_to_agent tool.\nAvailable agents: [list agent IDs]\nIf your task is complete, respond normally without using the tool.\n```\n\n## Workflow Pattern Requirements\n\nNo routing fields required (DAG determines order).\nOptional: Structured JSON for better data flow between tasks.\n\n## Action\n\nIf the prompt is missing required response format instructions for the detected pattern, ADD them.\nDo not modify prompts that already have correct instructions."
